# File: user_run_SDM.r
# Purpose: Run a full SDM model, or pickup an existing run executed using run_SDM.
# After running a full model, save this file in the species' 'loc_scripts' folder

# Step 1: Download updated scripts from GitHub repository
# Usage: to put the latest modeling scripts in a new folder created in 'loc_scripts' (set below),
# which are used for new modeling runs

# set project folder, db, species code, and species reaches filename for this run
rm(list=ls())
# The main modelling folder for inputs/outputs. All sub-folders are created during the model run (when starting with step 1)
loc_model <- "D:/testing_SDM/aqua_dev/species"
# Modeling database - provide full path
project_db <- "D:/testing_SDM/aqua_dev/databases/sdm_tracking_aqua_dev.sqlite"
# species code - from lkpSpecies in modelling database. This will be the new folder name in loc_model.
model_species <- "chrocumb"
# locations file (presence reaches). Provide full path; The file is copied to modeling folder and timestamped.
nm_presFile <- "D:/SDM/Tobacco/inputs/species/chrocumb/reach_data/chrocumb.csv"

## this downloads latest scripts from GitHub (you can save this 'get_scripts.R' 
## file anywhere on your computer, so you don't have to change the path)
## github branch to download
branch <- "aqua_dev"
source("E:/git/aquatic/Regional_SDM/helper/get_scripts.R", local = TRUE)
## NOTE any messages, and download/place scripts manually if necessary

## loc_scripts should now be set; if it failed, 
## manually set loc_scripts path below if get_scripts fails
loc_scripts <- "E:/git/aquatic/Regional_SDM/"

# remove everything but necessary variables
rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE)[!ls(all.names = TRUE) %in% c("project_db","model_species","loc_scripts", "loc_model", "nm_presFile")])

# set wd and load function
setwd(loc_scripts)
source("helper/run_SDM.R")

# End step 1 #
##############

# Step 2: execute a new model
# Usage: For a full, new model run, provide all paths/file names to arguments 'loc_scripts' THROUGH 'modeller'.

# Optional arguments for all runs include:
# 1. begin_step: specify as the prefix of the step to begin with: one of ("1","2","3","4","4b","4c","5").
#     Defaults to "1", so not necessary to specify for new runs.
# 2. prompt: if TRUE, the function will stop after each script, and ask if you want to continue. 
#     Defaults to FALSE.
# 3. add_vars: variables that are not part of the standard set for this species, which you wish to 
#     include in the model run.
# 4. remove_vars: variables that are part of the standard set for this species, which you wish to
#     remove from the model run.
# 5. huc_level: a numeric, 2-12. if used, will subset the background/prediction are of the model to 
#     the given HUC-level watershed(s) that presence reaches are within. Requires the 'huc12' column
#     to be present and populated in the presence reaches csv, env. vars csv, and all flowlines shapefile.

# RUN A NEW MODEL (ALL STEPS 1-5)
# If picking up from a previous run (after step 1), use Step 2-alt below
# update the function arguments below as necessary, and run the function
